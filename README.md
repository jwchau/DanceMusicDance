## Challenges

* The creativity aspect of this project had me hit a wall sometimes, because there's so many different ways to visualize MUSIC, let alone just one sound at a moment in time.
* The math for some of the drawings were a bit weird, and I still don't have 100% understanding of it. Coordinate space, distance calculations, timing, loops, etc.
* HTML structure and CSS matching were difficult to figure out because I used p5 in global mode, which creates html elements and appends it to the body. So I had to individually attach to the appropriate containers I created.

## My thoughts about the project

* Overall I felt it was a pretty fun project to do. I definitely solidified my understanding of pure JavaScript.
* I certainly felt the arduous process of repeatedly hard coding things like buttons and checkboxes. If I could go back in time and redo, I would make it more modular.
* I felt pretty relaxed during development as this wasn't a strict structure by any means. I think that's an important mindset to be in while developing or else one would be tied down by specifics of every detail.
