## Challenges

* Due to the large amount of data this project naturally encompasses I needed a programmative solution to seed the database.
* The Active Storage and AWS S3 implementation was very buggy and I still don't full understand the inner workings of how rails does it's magic.
* HTML structure and CSS matching were difficult because imdb.com is not very reliant on React.js so I had to create, yet imitate the same look the original site has.

## My thoughts about the project

* Overall I felt it was a great learning experience for fullstack implementation.
* The repetition of React/Redux -> Rails pattern really help drill the frontend to backend integration pattern.
* I felt a little slow during development and didn't get to finish as much functionality as I thought I would.
* As I continue this project I will update my thoughts about it.
